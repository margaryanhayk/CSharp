//You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
//The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
//ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
//ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
//ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
//Return the number of items that match the given rule.
